                <li>Mix flour & salt into large bowl</li>
                <li>Cut in butter & shortening until it resembles coarse meal </li>
                <li>Add the 1/2 cup ice water, 1 Tbsp at a time</li>
                <li>Stir with woden or rubber spatula after each Tbsp of water. <strong>STOP</strong> when large clumps begin to form</li>
                <li>Transfer dough to floured surface.</li>
                <li>Fold dough into self until flour is fully incorporated</li>
                <li>Form into ball and divide in half</li>
                <li><strong>Note:</strong>This will make the top and bottom of your pie, if you are making a pie that does not need a top (ex:Quiche or Lemon Meringue), you can use this for 2 bottoms</li>
                <li>Flatten into 1 Inch discs and wrap tightly with plastic wrap</li>
                <li>Refrigerate for at least 2h up to 2-3 days</li>
                <li><strong>Note:</strong>I typically make my dough the night before, but if you want to make multiple crust for future pies you can store in freezer for about 3 months</li>

        <br>
        <p>
            I started making Pies in 2020 during the pandemic and have learnt many things during that time. Mainly, no mater how difficult the dough is, it will bake up just fine. The hardest part to control is the humidity in the environment, if it is a dry day adjust the water content. It will make things much easier to roll out. It is also important to keep the butter as cold as possible until you put it into the oven. This will allow for a nicer pie crust. We only want the butter to melt when everything is baking to get a butter crust. The addition of vegetable shortening will help make the crust flakey. I have found this combination makes for the best combination of both those qualities.
            <br>
            <br>
            As for what pie filling is the best that is subjective, but the easiest fillings are usually a berry or apple. Lemon Meringue, for example, is a much harder pie because of the meringue top and the the filling itself has a lot of steps to it. So starting out with a blueberry, strawberry rhubarb or apple will be simplest. Since I live in Alberta, I have the luxury of having access to Saskatoon berries. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Saskatoons are found in the Prairie provinces and are a smaller berry in comparison to blueberries. I find they have a more sweet flavour and are less prone to getting mushy. This quality for me makes them the better choice for a pie filling over blueberries It also helps that I prefer saskatoons to a blueberries.

                1) The egg will be used on top of the pie as a wash so will also need about 1Tbsp of milk. The mixture is usually more than you'd need for 1 pie top<br>
                2) try to pick out a nice lemon as we will be zesting it and juicing it for the berries to sit in.

                <li>Preheat oven to 425Â°F</li>
                <li>Zest and juice lemon</li>
                <li>Mix lemon juice, lemon zest and cornstarch together. Once mixed add berries and set aside</li>
                <li>Roll out bottom crust to size for pan, making sure to keep it as even as possible.</li>
                <i><strong>Note:</strong>if the dough hangs over the sides of the pan that is preferable, we will cut the extra at a later step</i>
                <li>Fill the bottom with berry mixture, straining the juice as you go.</li>
                <i><strong>Note:</strong>It is important to strain the juice from the berries otherwise you will have a soupier filling when you go to cut. You can also cut a Tbsp of cold butter and sprinkle it evenly on top of the berries to help cook and brown the pie top</i>
                <li>Cover with top, at this point you can cut any excess dough while you pinch the sides together.</li>
                <i><strong>Note:</strong> For the top you can either roll it out to fit the size of the pie, and then cut into strips to make a lattice top. Or you can place the round piece on top and cut some vent holes to let steam escape. Either way it is advisable to place the bottom half or the pie in fridge while you work on top to keep it cool.</i>
                <li>Brush on egg wash</li>
                <li><strong>Optional:</strong>You can also sprinkle coarse sugar(also known as decorating sugar) on top after the egg wash. </li>
                <li>Once pie is assembled place in heated oven for 15min</li>
                <li><strong>Reduce</strong> to 350Â°F and cook for 50-55min</li>
                <li><strong>Note:</strong>It is advisable to cover the edges once they begin to brown with wither a pie shield or a makeshift one out of tinfoil. this is important to do to avoid burning the edges. As well the pie may finish cooking before 50min, be sure to check regularly.</li>
                <li>When pie is brown and filling is bubbling the pie is done.</li>
                <li>Remove and let sit for desired pie temperature</li>

        <h1><b>Advice</b></h1>
            <p>
                To get the most flavour out of your filling I like to let mine sit for a minimum of 15-30 minutes. This way the berries have a chance to soak up the lemon flavour and also release more juice before it enters the pie. If you don't like cornstarch as a thickener tapioca or even flour, but if you choose to do that make sure you find the appropriate ratio for the substitute.
                <br>
                <br>
                Keep an eye on your pie, it can brown very easily. No one wants a burnt crust. 
                <br>
                <br>
                If you are interested in making more than one pie, pie shields are a great investment, but if it is a once in a while bake then making your own out of tinfoil works fine. It is just a lot more finicky than a pie shield.
