                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>One of my favourit foods are the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies that is from a recipe that my mom got from somewhere. They are one of the most popular kinds of cookie. Basically just regular chocolate chip cookies with oats, and I like to add walnuts. My mom used to make them sometimes and then when I learned to bake they were one of the first things I made. I still like making them quite often and everyone else that lives with me likes it when I make them too.</p>
                <p>There are tons of recipes out there, but I think these one might be the best. I may be biased since I have had them since I was a kid and I really like to make them when I get the chance, but I do think these cookies are really good. Especially, since they are home made cookies. Home made cookies are always better than store bought. This page of the webiste will explain everything you need to know about making these delicious cookies, including the reicpe, the instructions and then how to keep them after you're done.</p>

                <h3>Baking</h3>
                <p>I have almost always liked baking. There are so many things you can make and I find it so much fun to do. The stuff you make tastes good too. I remember being really young when I started helping to bake all the christmas stuff. In my family we used to bake tons of different things around the holidays and I really enjoyed helping out. My favourite thing to bake is probably cookie but I do also like to bake cakes and muffins. </p>
                <p>With these cookies, I have experimented to find out the best ratios of ingredients. I know that having more brown sugar makes your cookies more soft, so I tested out more brown sugar and less white sugar, as well as less brown sugar and more white sugar until I decided this was the correct amount. This recipe also asks for too many chocolate chips. Which is a weird thing to say because I really like chocolate. The times that I have added all the 2 cups of chocolate chips the cookies kept falling apart as I was trying to put them on the cookie sheet. So I tend to add less than the recipe says.</p>

                <h2>Storing</h2>
                <p>Store cookies in airtight container to keep them fresh, but first make sure that they have cooled off completely. Otherwise you will be trapping heat inside your container. Putting parchment paper or waxed paper between your cookies can help so that they don't stick together when storing. They can last in room temperature for a short period of time, but keeping them in a colder place keeps them fresher longer.</p>

                <h2>Freezing</h2>
                <p>You can definitely freeze your cookies. Just store them in an airtight container and put them in the freezer until you would like to eat your cookies. This way they can stay good for even several months. We like to freeze our cookies so that our cookies stay nice for a lot longer of a time. Plus it's nice, because you can take out a couple at a time without thawing all of them if you just want a quick sweet treat.</p>
