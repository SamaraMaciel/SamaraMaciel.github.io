    <h1>Making my Favorite Lumpia Shanghai</h1>

    <h2>What is Lumpia Shanghai? </h2>
    <p>Lumpiang Shanghai is Filipino-style spring rolls made of ground pork, chicken, or beef filling wrapped in thin crepes called lumpia wrappers. The meat-stuffed wrappers are rolled into thin cylindrical shapes, cut into bite-size lengths, and deep-fried to golden perfection.</p>
    <p>They're so tasty and addictive that you'd be hard-pressed to eat just one. Plus, they can be frozen for any time lumpia fix!</p>

    <h3>How to Store Them</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Store in resealable bags and keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</li>
        <li>To freeze, arrange the lumpia in a single layer with some space in between on a baking sheet. Wrap tightly with cling wrap and freeze for about 1 to 2 hours or until firm. This step will prevent them from sticking together. Transfer in resealable bags and freeze for up to 3 months.</li>
        <li>To fry, do not thaw. Heat about 2-inch deep of oil to 350 F and carefully add the rolls. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until golden, crispy, and fully cooked.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Serve</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lumpia shanghai is a popular mainstay in Filipino gatherings and celebrations alongside pancit guisado, spaghetti, and other party fares. They're also commonly served as the main dish for breakfast, lunch, or dinner with steamed or fried rice.</li>
        <li>The crispy spring rolls are traditionally enjoyed with dipping sauces such as sweet and sour, lechon sarsa, banana ketchup, and sweet chili.</li>
