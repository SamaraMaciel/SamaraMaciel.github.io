                <h2>What is Lumpia <br>Shanghai</h2>
                <p> Lumpiang Shanghai is Filipino-style spring rolls made of ground pork, chicken, or beef filling
                    wrapped in thin crepes called lumpia wrappers.The meat-stuffed wrappers are rolled into thin cylindrical 
                    shapes, cut into bite-size lengths, and deep-fried to golden perfection.They're so tasty and addictive 
                    that you'd be hard-pressed to eat just one. Plus, they can be frozen for any time lumpia fix!
                    Lumpia shanghai is a popular mainstay in Filipino gatherings and celebrations alongside pancit guisado, spaghetti, 
                    and other party fares. They're also commonly served as the main dish for breakfast, lunch, or dinner with steamed or fried rice.

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p> I am much more into baking cakes or breads. But when it comes to thinking of quick snacks or menu for guest, lumpia shanghai is one 
                    of my go to dish.Lumpia Shanghai is one of my favorite make-ahead meals.Every other weekend, I roll up my sleeves and roll up a few 
                    dozen, along with siomai,longganisa, and kikiam, to freeze for when I am too busy or tired to spend more than thirty minutes in the kitchen.         
                    With these food items already prepped in the freezer, a home-cooked dinner is just a matter of quick frying.

                <h2>How to Store Them</h2>  
                <p> Store in resealable bags and keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
                    To freeze, arrange the lumpia in a single layer with some space in between on a baking sheet. 
                    Wrap tightly with cling wrap and freeze for about 1 to 2 hours or until firm. This step will 
                    prevent them from sticking together. Transfer in resealable bags and freeze for up to 3 months.
                    To fry, do not thaw. Heat about 2-inch deep of oil to 350 F and carefully add the rolls. Cook for 
                    3 to 4 minutes until golden, crispy, and fully cooked.

                <h2>How to Serve</h2>
                <p> The crispy spring rolls are traditionally enjoyed with dipping sauces such as sweet and sour, lechon sarsa, 
                    banana ketchup, and sweet chili. Make it a meal by pairing your lumpia with garlic rice or serving it as an 
                    appetizer for a traditional Filipino main dish, such as Caldereta

                    <h2>Helpful Tips</h2>
                    <p> I like to use ground chicken with chopped water chestnuts, shredded carrots, green 
                        onions, and garlic for extra flavor and crunch. Feel free to substitute ground pork or 
                        beef and add minced shrimp if you like. You can also use jicama (singkamas), diced bell 
                        peppers, celery, onions, and raisins. <br><br>
                
                        Do a taste test! Fry a small amount of the meat mixture and adjust seasonings as 
                        needed before wrapping.<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <img src="./images/Lumpia_Shanghai.jpg" alt="Lumpia" class="float-left">
               
                    <p> Use fresh spring roll wrappers. Check manufacturing dates on packages, as the older the 
                        wrappers get, the less pliable and harder they are to roll.<br>
                
                        While rolling, cover the rest of the wrappers with a damp cloth to prove them from 
                        drying out.<br><br>
                    </p>
                
                    <p> Do not overfill wrappers to ensure quick cooking. Roll the logs as tight as possible 
                        to prevent grease from seeping in.<br><br>
                
                        Lumpia are best deep-fried. Use enough frying oil to cover the rolls fully. Watch 
                        your temperatures! If too low, the lumpia will absorb more grease. If too high, the 
                        wrappers will burn before fully cooked.<br><br>
                    </p>   
                        
                    <p> Cook in batches to prevent the oil from plummeting, and bring the oil back up to the 
                        optimal 350F to 375 F range before adding the next round. Skim the oil in between batches
                        to remove any burnt bits.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <img src="./images/Lumpia_Shanghai_Sauce.jpg" alt="Sauce" class="float-right">
                    <p> Do not drain on paper towels, or they'll get soggy with the steam. Drain on a wire rack set 
                        over a baking sheet or in a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl to catch oil drips.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p> If transporting them to a party, leave the container partially open to keep the lumpia crispy 
                        as long as possible.<br><br>

                <ol >
                    <li>In a bowl, combine ground chicken, green onions, water chestnuts, carrots, garlic, soy sauce, salt, and pepper until well distributed.</li>
                    <li>Separate wrappers into individual sheets and lay on a flat working surface.</li>
                    <li>Spoon about 1 heaping tablespoon of meat mixture on the lower end of the wrapper, closest to you.</li>
                    <li>Fold the bottom of wrapper over filling and continue to roll tightly into a thin log about ¾-inch thick. Wet the remaining edge of the wrapper with a dab of water to completely seal.</li>
                    <li>Repeat with the remaining mixture. Using scissors, cut each lumpia roll into about 3-inch lengths.</li>
                    <li>Using a slotted spoon or tongs, remove from the oil and drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Serve immediately with sweet and sour sauce or banana ketchup</li>
